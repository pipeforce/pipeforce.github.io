                This Cookie Policy explains how Termly ("
                <strong>Company</strong>", "<strong>we</strong>", "
                <strong>us</strong>", and "<strong>our</strong>") uses cookies
                and similar technologies to recognize you when you visit our
                websites, ("<strong>Websites</strong>"). It explains what these

              <p>
                In some cases we may use cookies to collect personal
                information, or that becomes personal information if we combine

              <h3>What are cookies?</h3>
              <br />
              <p>
                Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or
                mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used
                by website owners in order to make their websites work, or to
                work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting
                information.
              </p>
              <p>
                Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Termly) are
                called "first party cookies". Cookies set by parties other than
                the website owner are called "third party cookies". Third party
                cookies enable third party features or functionality to be
                provided on or through the website (e.g. like advertising,
                interactive content and analytics). The parties that set these
                third party cookies can recognize your computer both when it
                visits the website in question and also when it visits certain
                other websites.
              </p>

              <h3>Why do we use cookies?</h3>
              <br />
              <p>
                We use first and third party cookies for several reasons. Some
                cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our
                Websites to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or
                "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies also enable us to
                track and target the interests of our users to enhance the
                experience on our Online Properties. Third parties serve cookies
                through our Websites for advertising, analytics and other
                purposes. This is described in more detail below.
              </p>
              <p>
                The specific types of first and third party cookies served
                through our Websites and the purposes they perform are described
                below (please note that the specific cookies served may vary
                depending on the specific Online Properties you visit):
